# Summary
This is what you may call my station on the internet. I blog about sofware engineering topics that I am fascinated by and learning, challenges I am currently working on and 
anything in between. Look at the [tags](https://www.iorosie.com/tags) to filter by topic you are interested in.

## Motivation
I wanted to build something for myself and the best way to maintain was to have it all hosted on the cloud 
but with me having full control of the site design and content management. 



## Built with
