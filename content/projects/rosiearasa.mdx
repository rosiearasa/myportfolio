# Summary
You are currently on this project. Here I showcase the projects I am working on, I have worked on and contact details. You can follow the links to the 
projects on Github to follow my progress. If you are here looking for my blog you can find it [here I/O Rosie](https://iorosie.com)

## Motivation
I wanted to learn how to build a production ready Nextjs application and I also happened to be shopping around for a place to store all my projects. 
Nextjs and Vercel work really well in my experience from building [I/O Rosie](https://iorosie.com) therefore this template offered another clean solution that 
was easy to implement. 



## Built with 
- [Template](https://github.com/chronark/chronark.com)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)
- Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=envshare)
- Data stored on [Upstash](https://upstash.com?utm_source=envshare)
